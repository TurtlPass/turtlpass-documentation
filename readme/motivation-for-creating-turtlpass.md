# âœ¨ Motivation for Creating TurtlPass

One of the main motivations for creating TurtlPass was the recognition of the importance of strong and unique passwords in today's digital world. With so many high-profile cases of hacking in the news, it is clear that online security is more important than ever. At the same time, I also recognized that it can be difficult for individuals, including myself, to come up with and remember strong passwords for all of the different services we use.

I wanted to address these issues with TurtlPass. By creating a tool that generates strong, unique passwords using a secure algorithm, I hoped to provide users with a solution that would give them peace of mind and protect their accounts from online attacks. Additionally, by making it easy for users to generate and use strong passwords, I hoped to alleviate the burden of having to remember multiple complex passwords.

Ultimately, my motivation for creating TurtlPass was to help protect individuals and businesses from online attacks by offering a password solution that is both secure and easy to use.
