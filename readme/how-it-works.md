# ðŸš€ How it Works

Using the client app (Android or the Chrome Extension) select the **App** or **Domain Name** you want to generate a password for, enter your **Account ID** (typically your email), and **choose a PIN** code. Every time you want to change the password, you just need to use a different PIN. The PIN is never stored anywhere and is the only thing you need to memorize in the entire process.

A **hash of the inputs** using Argon2 is **sent via USB serial** to the TurtlPass device that then uses a deterministic key derivation function (**HKDF**) to generate a **100-character password** that includes a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers.

Once you **touch the sensor** on the TurtlPass device, the hardware-generated **password is typed automatically** using a virtual keyboard.
