# üèùÔ∏è Embracing Turtle Conservation

As the founder of TurtlPass, I'm committed to leaving a positive footprint on our planet, both digitally and environmentally. That's why I've pledged to donate **5%** of all future profits towards turtle conservation efforts. By supporting TurtlPass, you're not just safeguarding your digital security; you're also contributing to the preservation of our precious turtle populations.

I'm passionate about giving back to nature and aiding the dedicated volunteers working tirelessly to protect our turtle friends. Your support is invaluable to me, and together, we can make a tangible impact on both the digital and physical realms.

Thank you for considering joining us on this meaningful journey.
