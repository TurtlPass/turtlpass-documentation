### üîë TurtlPass ‚â† FIDO

TurtlPass is **not** a **FIDO** Security Key and does **not** intend to be one. If you're looking for that, check [pico-fido](https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-fido) project. **TurtlPass** is intended for **all the other websites/apps** that don't support hardware security keys, the ones with a `password` field :)
