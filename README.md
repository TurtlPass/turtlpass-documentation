## ‚ö° Features

- **Hardware Password Generator**
  - Unlimited passwords generated on the device
- **Hardware 2FA Manager**
  - One-time passwords are generated on the device and your keys are stored encrypted with AES-256
- **Hardware Encryption**
  - Files encrypted on the device using the ChaCha20 algorithm


## üöÄ How it Works

Using the client app (Android or the Chrome Extension) select the **App/Domain** you want to generate a password for, enter your **Account ID** (typically your email), and **choose a PIN**. Every time you want to change the password, you just need to use a different PIN. The PIN is never stored anywhere and is the only thing you need to memorize in the entire process.

A **hash of the inputs** using Argon2 is **sent via USB serial** to the TurtlPass device that then uses a deterministic key derivation function (**HKDF**) to generate a **100-character password** that includes a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers.

Once you **touch the sensor** on the TurtlPass device, the hardware-generated **password is typed automatically** using a virtual keyboard.


## üè∞ Fortified Against Cyber Threats

* TurtlPass doesn't rely on a server, making it immune to server-based attacks.
* Passwords generated by TurtlPass cannot be extracted because they are not stored anywhere.
* TurtlPass safeguards against shoulder-surfing attacks by concealing password input during public use.
* Its complex and lengthy passwords prevent social engineering attacks or accidental disclosure.
* TurtlPass avoids online breaches by never reusing passwords; leaked password hashes only correspond to one account.
* With passwords of 100 characters, TurtlPass resists brute-force attacks that would take many years to crack.
* It thwarts dictionary attacks by not using recognizable words.
* TurtlPass does not reference personal information, making it resistant to AI word list attacks.
* It generates unique passwords of 100 characters to fend off attacks utilizing password lists.
* TurtlPass avoids database vulnerabilities by not relying on databases.
* It operates offline, connecting only via USB.
* TurtlPass accepts commands through USB serial and mimics a keyboard to input passwords.
* Passwords entered by TurtlPass cannot be picked up by microphones.
* It defends against thermal attacks as passwords are not manually entered.
* TurtlPass bypasses clipboard attacks by not utilizing the clipboard.
* It mitigates keylogger threats.


## üí™ Motivation for Creating TurtlPass

One of the main motivations for creating TurtlPass was the recognition of the importance of strong and unique passwords in today's digital world. With so many high-profile cases of hacking in the news, it is clear that online security is more important than ever. At the same time, I also recognized that it can be difficult for individuals, including myself, to come up with and remember strong passwords for all of the different services we use.

I wanted to address these issues with TurtlPass. By creating a tool that generates strong, unique passwords using a secure algorithm, I hoped to provide users with a solution that would give them peace of mind and protect their accounts from online attacks. Additionally, by making it easy for users to generate and use strong passwords, I hoped to alleviate the burden of having to remember multiple complex passwords.

Ultimately, my motivation for creating TurtlPass was to help protect individuals and businesses from online attacks by offering a password solution that is both secure and easy to use.


## üê¢ Meaning Behind the TurtlPass Name

I was inspired by the turtle when creating TurtlPass - these wise, resilient creatures have been around for centuries, enduring all types of challenges and obstacles. That's exactly why I chose the turtle as the inspiration for our powerful password generator.

With TurtlPass, you'll get strong and secure passwords, just like the turtle's enduring strength and wisdom. Our tool is designed to withstand even the most determined attacks, giving you the peace of mind you deserve. So don't just settle for any old password - choose TurtlPass and let the might of the turtle protect your systems.


## üíö Embracing Turtle Conservation

As the founder of TurtlPass, I'm committed to leaving a positive footprint on our planet, both digitally and environmentally. That's why I've pledged to donate 5% of all future profits towards turtle conservation efforts. By supporting TurtlPass, you're not just safeguarding your digital security; you're also contributing to the preservation of our precious turtle populations. 

I'm passionate about giving back to nature and aiding the dedicated volunteers working tirelessly to protect our turtle friends. Your support is invaluable to me, and together, we can make a tangible impact on both the digital and physical realms. 

Thank you for considering joining us on this meaningful journey.
