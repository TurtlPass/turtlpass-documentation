# üõ°Ô∏è Security

It's important to remember that if someone has physical access to the device, they may be able to compromise the seeds with enough time and effort. However, even if the seeds are compromised, it's impossible to recreate the passwords generated by TurtlPass without access to the hash result of the inputs, such as the PIN code, Domain Name, and Account ID (via the client app).

<summary>Cloning RP2040</summary>

It is important to note that the firmware binary on the Raspberry Pi Pico RP2040 can be easily extracted using [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) due to its utilization of external ROM.

Example of how to do just that:

```
$ picotool save firmware.uf2

Saving file: [==============================]  100%
Wrote 369000 bytes to firmware.uf2
```

<summary>Secure Element (SE)</summary>

Using a secure element such as the **ATECC608A/B** or **OPTIGA Trust X/M** for password generation can be a secure solution due to its physical tamper-resistance and isolation from the rest of the system. However, there are limitations to consider such as the difficulty in using them across multiple devices or platforms, and lack of backup or recovery options in case of loss or damage. Additionally, it may be difficult to manage and control access to the password in situations where multiple users need to access it.
