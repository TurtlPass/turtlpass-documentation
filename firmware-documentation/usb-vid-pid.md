### pid.codes

[pid.codes](https://pid.codes/) is an initiative aimed at addressing the challenges faced by makers, hobbyists, and small companies in obtaining USB Vendor IDs and Product IDs. Recognizing the prohibitive costs associated with acquiring unique IDs from the USB-IF, [pid.codes](https://pid.codes/) provides an alternative solution by offering gifted Vendor IDs from companies that are no longer active.

[pid.codes](https://pid.codes/) generously provided TurtlPass with a USB Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID), enabling us to uniquely identify our USB device without financial barriers.

### Usage

Developers and users who encounter TurtlPass USB devices in their systems can identify them using the provided VID and PID. This information can be useful for device recognition and software integration purposes.
