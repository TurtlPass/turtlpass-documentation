# ðŸ’¾ Backup

Just like having multiple copies of your car key for backup, having multiple TurtlPass-RP2040 devices with the same seed provides redundancy and peace of mind. You can keep one device in a secure location as a backup while using another one for daily use.

Alternatively, you can store the seed file offline in a secure location, but for maximum security, it's recommended to store it only inside a TurtlPass-RP2040 device, keeping it offline and inaccessible to potential threats.
